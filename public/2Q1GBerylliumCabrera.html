                <p> After Blue Lock achieved victory in the Japan U-20 match that was watched by Japan and the world at large, Jinpachi Ego was granted full reign over the 
                    Japan National Team, 
                    and many interested investors came forward wanting to invest in the Blue Lock Project and its potential. With complete control and additional resources, 
                    Ego chose to not only further train his players in preparation for the World 
                    Cup but also turn the training into a massive entertainment project that would 
                    engage and be viewed by the world through the new streaming service called Blue Lock TV. <br>
                <p>Ego invited all Blue Lock players who made it to the Third Selection, along with the regulars from the old Japan U-20, 
                    and made them decide on a country to train in. To ensure the players could combat "the world" in the upcoming World Cup, 
                    Ego decided to change the environment of Blue Lock to emulate the football scenes in Europe's Top 5 Leagues: France, Germany, England, Italy, and Spain. 
                    The players must select a country to train in based on their preferences and what they wish to gain from the training. Ego reveals that no matter where they go, 
                    this selection will inevitably change all the players' lives, either for better or for worse.<br>
                <p>When the players select their country, they will be separated into stratums based on that country and will have the opportunity to train with the U-20 level players of the 
                    best club team in those respective countries and the master striker who reigns over that team and country. After initial training, a team of 11 will be formed from 
                    those chosen as regulars by the master striker from the club team or Blue Lock to compete in a Round Robin tournament that will pit Blue Lock rivals and world-class 
                    players against each other in short but highly dynamic games. 
                    After the tournament concludes, the remaining top 23 players will be selected as members for the reconstructed Japan U-20 team in the upcoming U-20 World Cup. <br>
                <p>Only the players who can demonstrate "uniqueness" and bring value to a team that already stands at 
                    the pinnacle of the football world will be selected to play in the U-20 World Cup.</p>
